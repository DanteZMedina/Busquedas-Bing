Callback
Is a function that is to be executed after another funcition has finished executing - hence the name Callback

In javascript functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.


const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile("file.txt", function(err, data){
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});


Callback Hell 
also known as "Pyramid of doom", refers to a situation in JavaScript where multiple nested callbacks become difficult to understand, manage and maintain.
